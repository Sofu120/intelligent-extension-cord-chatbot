I will analyze our midterm report to determine what functions our LineBot should provide.

TO DO...
----------

1. HOW TO SHOW THE PLOT WITH DATA RETRIVED FROM SQLITE. 
2. WHAT FUNCTION CAN THE USER ACCESS IN OUR LINEBOT.
3. THE CONTROL FLOW FUNCTION SET BETWEEN THE LINEBOT( USER ) AND RASPERBARRY PI( AND THE OTHER SENSORS ).
